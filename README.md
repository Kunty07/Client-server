The project is a client-server chat for scraping Scopus information.

The server side is an extension of a Github repository, called scopus-scraper. You have to create a server that queries the following requests:

What are the last three documents of an author?
What are the subject areas of an author?
What are the metrics of an author?
The client side is a Telegram bot for making the requests like in a chat style.
